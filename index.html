     As taboo as it is to judge a book by its cover, I usually go for movies with posters I like or ones that seem engaging.

    <div class="answer-container3">
    <div class="answer-container3"><span class="speaker-2">MARIKA</span>One movie I did not like was “The Turning” because it had a weak plot and didn’t develop it’s relatively flat characters. The story concept sounded interesting, with a woman becoming a nanny for these two kids living in a Gothic mansion, but the movie itself wasn’t as interesting.

        My go-to movie is either “Lilo and Stitch” or “Mad Max: Fury Road.” “Lilo and Stitch” has always been one of my favorite Disney movies growing up, and “Mad Max: Fury Road” is one of my favorite movies currently. It also has my favorite cinematographic scenes in it.

      In your opinion, what makes a movie “good”?

          <div class="answer-container5"><span class="speaker-2">MARIKA</span>
        In my opinion, a movie is considered “good” depending on how well it tells its story. For example, a movie could have a really interesting plot but bad acting might get in the way of enjoying it, or a movie could have a great cast of actors, but the story is lacking in some areas which makes it less enjoyable to watch.

        What is the most valuable lesson/theme that you have learned from watching a movie? And what movie was it?

      The most valuable lesson I learned from watching a movie was the importance of being close and having a good relationship with your siblings, specifically my younger sister. Growing up we watched lots of Studio Ghibli movies and one of them was “My Neighbor Totoro.” In this movie it portrays what having a strong sense of family and having a sister can do in terms of optimism and hope.

       Did anything that happened in a particular movie remind you of something that has occurred in your own life or that you have seen occur to others?

       Yes, in the movie “Lion” there’s a scene where Dev Patel’s character asks his adoptive mom why she adopted two boys, and asked if it was because she couldn’t have children of her own. This scene was almost word for word with a conversation I had had with my own mom years ago when I was younger, wondering if she had adopted my sister and I because she couldn’t have kids.

        What are some different emotions or thoughts that you feel when watching different types of movies? Ex. emotions from watching horror movies vs watching a romantic drama movie

       <div class="answer-container7"><span class="speaker-2">MARIKA</span>
        With horror movies, like “Hereditary”, “Get Out”, and “Alien”, I usually feel an adrenaline rush throughout the movie, and more paranoia when it ends. With more “coming of age” movies like “Lady Bird”, “Booksmart”, and “mid90s”, I feel more nostalgic and bittersweet, especially for times when I was younger.

      If you had to choose one character from a movie that you resonate with the most, who would it be and why?

        One character I resonate the most with is Frances from “Frances Ha.” She’s a woman living in New York pursuing dance and navigating her way through life as a twenty-something year old, out of college and refusing to give up on her dreams and goals. This character resonated with me because the same thoughts, goals, and fears she had in the movie are similar ones I have, especially when I first moved to New York for school.

      The newest version of “Little Women” inspired me to pick up writing again, which is something I used to love to do in middle school but eventually became too busy to do it as much. The main character, Jo March, is a writer and seeing this movie when it came out last year made me start writing more.

    Yes, Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” used an overwhelming amount of pinks and neutral colors, which are my favorite colors, against more bold and contrasting colors, like reds and purples. Seeing stark contrasting colors against more muted ones made me realize how much of my work uses muted, pastel, and neutral colors. This inspired me to want to branch out more and use a wider range of color in my work.
